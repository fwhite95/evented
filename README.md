# Run the App 

## Option 1: Android Studio

### 1. Using Android studio create a new project from vcs using git
### 2. Use the github link to download the project
### 3. While the project is downloading it may ask to configure with android, DO NOT. 
### 4. Open an Android Emulator and hit run. 
### 5. Should open on the Android Emulator

## Possible Errors: 1. Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'
### 1. Check under project structure the Project SDK. I am using version 29
### 2. Under project structure -> platform settings -> Android SDK home path. 
### change the path to correspond to your android sdk 


## Option 2: VS Code

### 1. Using VSCode create a new project from vcs using git
### 2. Use the github link to download the project
### 4. Open an Android Emulator and start debugging. 
### 5. Should open on the Android Emulator

## Possible Errors: 1. Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'
### 1. Will need to modify the project sdk and the path to the android sdk
### I am not sure how to do this but if you do it should work. 

##Option 3: Run on Phone
## Theoretically should work for android or ios phone but I have not tested it on an iphone
## 1. After downloading the project from github it can be run by: 
### 1. Having an android phone connected through usb cable and running through Android Studio or VSCode
### 2. Using the terminal and installing with flutter install (directory should be the base of the project)
